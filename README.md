# Pokémon Uranium Scripts
Short suite of Python scripts that come in handy when translating and localising Pokémon Uranium.

To run any of the scripts, install Python 3, and then execute one via `py scriptname.py` or `python3 scriptname.py` in a command terminal.

## ObscureText
Text obscuring tool for the burnt notebook pages in Map123.

The input is a text file containing regular language (the full translated lines). The output is that same text file, but with some characters, and sometimes entire words, "obscured" (replaced by a `-`, for example) to imitate having been burnt or faded. The result may be modified at will to make reading a tad bit easier.

## WhitenImmediateDupicateLines
Preparation tool for replacing the English placeholders for untranslated lines by blank lines, to make them more visible.
