# ObscureText
Text obscuring tool for translators of the burnt notebook pages in Pok√©mon Uranium.

The input is a text file containing regular language (the full translated lines). The output is that same text file, but with some characters, and sometimes entire words, "obscured" (replaced by a `-`, for example) to imitate having been burnt or faded. The result may be modified at will to make reading a tad bit easier.
